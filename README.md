# Quantity Measurement App - UC13 (CentralizedArithmetic  )

### 📌 Overview

- UC13 refactors the arithmetic operations introduced in UC12 by centralising all shared validation, unit conversion, and base-unit arithmetic logic into private helper methods.
- This refactoring enforces the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, reduces code duplication, and improves maintainability, while keeping all public APIs and behaviours unchanged.

### ⚙️ Use Case: UC13 Centralised Arithmetic Logic

- Eliminate repeated logic across the add, subtract, and divide methods
- Ensure consistent validation and error handling for all arithmetic operations
- Improve readability and maintainability of arithmetic logic
- Provide a scalable foundation for future operations (multiply, modulo, etc.)
- Preserve all UC12 behaviour and existing test cases

### ⚙️ Key Implementation Points (Brief)

- Centralised validation logic in one private helper method.
- Single helper for base-unit conversion and arithmetic.
- `ArithmeticOperation` enum (ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE) encapsulates operation logic.
- `add`, `subtract`, `divide` delegate to shared helpers.
- Implicit and explicit target unit behaviour preserved.
- Public APIs unchanged; UC12 tests pass as-is.
- DRY enforced, cleaner code, easier future extension.
