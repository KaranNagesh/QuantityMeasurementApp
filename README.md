# Quantity Measurement Application
### Project Overview
#### The Quantity Measurement Application validates equality, unit conversions, and arithmetic operations across multiple measurement categories:

 - Length: Feet, Inches, Yards, Centimeters
 - Weight: Kilogram, Gram, Pound
##### The project follows best practices:

✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD) ✅ Feature Branch Workflow ✅ Clean Code Practices ✅ DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) Principle ✅ Robust Unit Conversion Strategy ✅ Multi-category Measurement Architecture

### Feature History
*📅 17 Feb 2026*

#### 🔹 UC1 – Feet Equality Verification
Branch: feature/UC1-FeetEquality

🎯 Objective

 - Check if two measurements in Feet are equal
 -Correctly override equals() for comparison
 - Apply Test-Driven Development principles

✅ Implementation

 - Defined Feet class for encapsulating measurement
 - Added precise equality logic using Double.compare()
 -Ensured null safety and type validation
 - Created comprehensive JUnit 5 tests
 -

**🔹 UC2 – Feet and Inches Equality Verification  **
Branch: feature/UC2-InchEquality

🎯 Objective

- Extend UC1 to check equality of measurements in Inches along with Feet
- Ensure proper equals() logic for both units
- Maintain Test-Driven Development approach

✅ Implementation

- Defined Inches class alongside Feet class
- Added equality logic for Inches using Double.compare()
- Validated numeric input for both units
- Ensured null safety and type validation
- Reduced main method dependency by creating dedicated methods for Feet and Inches equality
- Created JUnit 5 test cases covering same and different values, nulls, and self-reference

📅 19 Feb 2026  

**🔹 UC3 – Generic Quantity Class for DRY Principle  **
Branch: feature/UC3-GenericLength

🎯 Objective

- Refactor Feet and Inches classes into a single QuantityLength class
- Apply DRY principle to remove code duplication
- Maintain all equality and conversion functionality from UC1 & UC2
- Enable easy extension for new units

✅ Implementation

- Introduced LengthUnit enum for all supported units and conversion factors
- Created QuantityLength class handling value + unit
- Centralized equality logic using base unit conversion
- Ensured type safety, null handling, and numeric validation
- Added comprehensive JUnit 5 tests for same-unit, cross-unit, and invalid inputs
- All previous UC1 & UC2 functionality preserved
